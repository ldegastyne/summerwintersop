    <intro>People take summer and winter classes for a variety of reasons including earning credits toward graduating early, catching up, getting ahead, adding a major or minor, staying in Blacksburg, lightening the course load for fall and spring, or participating in study abroad. Depending on the class, it could be offered online, on campus, or both. If you are a potential student for these sessions, whether you are currently at Virginia Tech or not, you are in the right place. In the next section you will find instructions for registering for these classes.
